For example, core behavioral competencies such as academically engaged or disruptive behaviors could be appropriate targets, or targets could be mapped to schoolwide behavior expectations. The DBR scale includes a range from 0-10, with descriptors or pictures added to assist the rater. DBR procedures involve rating target behaviors following specified observation period(s) (e.g., math intervention; ELA core instruction). Typically, the teacher serves as the rater, although multiple informants including the student could be added. After each observation period, the rater uses the DBR form to indicate the degree to which the student displayed each behavior. When used as part of a Tier 2 intervention, the rater reminds the students of the expected behaviors prior beginning the observation. The rater meets briefly with the student to share the DBR rating, providing behavior specific praise and instructional feedback. Additional components involving family-school communication can be added as appropriate (e.g., daily ratings shared with caregiver, request for return acknowledgement or possible consequences).",
