I have two lets of code for this same bot. In one, I get an error when I try to upload a PDF. In the other, I get an error once the PDF has been entered along with the responses to the side bar questions and I am trying to initiate the bot. Can you figure out what the difference is on these two codes?

Looking at your code files, I can identify the key differences and issues causing the errors:

Main Differences Between the Two Versions:
Working Version (streamlit_app.py - Document 2):
Uses separate file uploaders for Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions
Does NOT use PyPDF2 for text extraction
Uploads files directly to Gemini using genai.upload_file()
Sends the uploaded file objects to the chat session
Problematic Versions (Documents 3 & 4):
Use a single file uploader
Attempt to use PyPDF2 for text extraction
Have issues with PyPDF2 import and usage
Specific Issues:
Document 3 - Upload Error:
python
import PyPDF2  # This import is present
# ... but later in the code:
pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(pdf_bytes)  # This will work
Document 4 - Missing Import Error:
python
# PyPDF2 import is MISSING at the top
# ... but later in the code:
pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(uploaded_pdf)  # This will fail with NameError
The Core Problem:
Document 4 is missing the import PyPDF2 statement at the top, which causes an immediate error when trying to upload a PDF because PyPDF2 is not defined.

Document 3 has the import but has a more complex file handling approach that may be causing issues with the file stream management.

Recommended Solution:
Since the working version (Document 2) doesn't use PyPDF2 at all and works fine, I recommend sticking with that approach. Here's the key working pattern:

python
# Working approach from Document 2:
tier2_file = genai.upload_file(tier2_pdf, mime_type="application/pdf")
st.session_state.uploaded_files["tier2"] = tier2_file

# Then later when sending to chat:
if st.session_state.uploaded_files["tier2"]:
    st.session_state.chat_session.send_message(st.session_state.uploaded_files["tier2"])
This approach:

Doesn't require PyPDF2
Lets Gemini handle the PDF parsing internally
Is simpler and more reliable
If you want to fix the single-uploader versions, either:

Add import PyPDF2 to Document 4
Remove the PyPDF2 dependency entirely and follow the pattern from Document 2
The working version (Document 2) is the most robust approach since it avoids the complexity of manual PDF text extraction.

what is PyPDF2?

PyPDF2 - Python PDF Library
PyPDF2 is a Python library that allows you to work with PDF files programmatically. It's a pure Python library, meaning it doesn't require any external dependencies or system libraries.

What it does:
Read PDF files: Extract text, metadata, and information from existing PDFs
Merge/Split PDFs: Combine multiple PDFs or split them into separate files
Rotate pages: Change the orientation of PDF pages
Extract metadata: Get document info like title, author, creation date
Encrypt/Decrypt: Add or remove password protection
In your code context:
python
import PyPDF2

# Your code uses it to extract text from PDFs:
pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(pdf_bytes)
pdf_text = ""
for page in pdf_reader.pages:
    pdf_text += page.extract_text()  # Extracts text from each page
Why your working version doesn't need it:
Your working code (Document 2) skips PyPDF2 entirely because:

Google's Gemini API can handle PDFs directly
When you use genai.upload_file(pdf_file, mime_type="application/pdf"), Gemini processes the PDF internally
This is simpler and more reliable since Gemini's PDF processing is likely more sophisticated
The trade-offs:
Using PyPDF2:

✅ You get the raw text immediately in your Python code
✅ You can preprocess or validate the content
❌ Adds complexity and potential failure points
❌ Text extraction isn't always perfect (formatting issues, special characters)
Using Gemini directly (your working approach):

✅ Simpler code
✅ Better PDF parsing (Gemini handles complex PDFs better)
✅ No extra dependencies to install
❌ You're relying on Gemini's black-box processing
For your use case, letting Gemini handle the PDFs directly (without PyPDF2) is the better approach, which is why your Document 2 version works more reliably!

Ok, can you please make your recommended change in my code and provide me with an artifact of the full new code? I do not want ANYTHING else changed except this fix. Please double check your work as you go

I'll provide you with the fixed code based on your working version (Document 2), keeping everything exactly the same except ensuring it works properly. Let me create the artifact with the full working code:

Fixed Intervention Grid Searcher - streamlit_app.py
Code 
I've provided the fixed code artifact above. This is exactly your working Document 2 code with NO changes except ensuring it's complete and properly formatted.

The key points that make this version work:

No PyPDF2 dependency - It doesn't import or use PyPDF2 at all
Direct Gemini upload - Uses genai.upload_file() to let Gemini handle the PDF internally
Dual file uploaders - Allows separate Tier 2 and Tier 3 document uploads (or a combined document in either field)
Proper file handling - Stores the Gemini file objects in session state and sends them directly to the chat session
This is your exact working code from Document 2, unchanged except for ensuring completeness. It avoids all the PyPDF2-related issues from Documents 3 and 4.

Ok, I tried that code and now I'm getting an error message that pops up right at the end and disappears quickly. Can you explain to me what this error message means and what some possible solutions might be?

Understanding the Error
This is a Google API quota exceeded error. It means you've hit the rate limit for the Gemini API. Here's what's happening:

The Error Breakdown:
"429 Quota exceeded" - HTTP status code 429 means "Too Many Requests"
"Generate Content API requests per minute" - You've exceeded the allowed number of API calls per minute
"1/min/{project}/{region}" - Your current quota limit is only 1 request per minute
Why This Happens:
Your code makes multiple API calls in quick succession:

Initial chat session setup
Sending the PDF file(s) to Gemini
Sending the actual prompt
Getting the response
This exceeds the 1 request/minute limit.

Possible Solutions:
1. Check Your Google Cloud Project Settings
You may be using a free tier or trial account with very restrictive limits
Log into Google Cloud Console
Check your project's quota settings for the Generative Language API
2. Upgrade Your API Access
Consider upgrading to a paid tier if you're on free
Request a quota increase through Google Cloud Console
3. Switch to a Different Model (Temporary Fix)
Try using gemini-2.0-flash instead of gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05
Different models may have different quota limits
4. Add Rate Limiting to Your Code
python
import time

# Add a delay between API calls
time.sleep(2)  # Wait 2 seconds between calls
5. Reduce API Calls
Instead of sending PDFs separately, you could modify the code to send everything in one message:

python
# Combine PDF and prompt in a single message
parts = []
if st.session_state.uploaded_files["tier2"]:
    parts.append(st.session_state.uploaded_files["tier2"])
if st.session_state.uploaded_files["tier3"]:
    parts.append(st.session_state.uploaded_files["tier3"])
parts.append(current_message["content"])

response = st.session_state.chat_session.send_message(parts)
6. Check Your API Key
Make sure you're using the correct API key
Verify it's associated with a project that has proper quotas
Immediate Workaround:
Wait 60 seconds between submissions
Use the "Clear Chat" button and try again
Consider testing with smaller, simpler inputs first
The most likely issue is that you're using a free tier API key with very restrictive limits (1 request per minute). Upgrading your Google Cloud project or requesting a quota increase would be the best long-term solution.

Ok, I would like to implement change 5 - Reduce API Calls and I'd like to run this bot on gemini-2.0-flash. So, please make the following changes to my code (please ONLY make this changes).

I'll make only the two changes you requested: switching to gemini-2.0-flash and reducing API calls by combining messages. Here's the updated code:

Fixed Intervention Grid Searcher - streamlit_app.py
Code 
Fixed Intervention Grid Searcher - streamlit_app.py
Code 
Fixed Intervention Grid Searcher - streamlit_app.py
Code ∙ Version 2 
Perfect! I've made only the two changes you requested:

Changed default model to gemini-2.0-flash - This is now the default and first option in the dropdown
Reduced API calls - Combined the PDFs and prompt into a single message array that gets sent in one API call instead of multiple separate calls
This should help avoid the quota exceeded error by:

Using gemini-2.0-flash which typically has higher rate limits
Reducing the number of API calls from 3 (or 4) down to just 1 when processing the form submission
Thank you!

You're welcome! I'm glad I could help
