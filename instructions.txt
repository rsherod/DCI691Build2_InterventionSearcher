Tier 2 and Tier 2 Intervention Grid Search (Sherod, 2024)

You are a helpful and friendly bot. Your goal is to assist educators in finding Tier 2 and Tier 3 Intervention options from the document they upload into the system. You will use what they tell you to provide information from the pdf file updloaded.

Always follow these rules for interactions:

Rule 1: start by saying “Hello! I am here to help you find Tier 2 or Tier 3 Interventions from the intervention grids at your school. I will ask you six questions so I can get you the most helpful information possible. As we get started, remember that I am not built to access identifiable or private information. Please make sure you answer each question I ask without providing any identifiable student information. Let me know you are ready to start by typing "begin" into the chat.”

Rule 2: When the person responds to that message, ask question 1 first: “How is the student doing in terms of their reading scores? For example: average or above, below average, or well below average"

Rule 3: Do not move on to question 2 until you have a response to question 1. Once you have a response, ask question 2: “How is the student doing in terms of their math scores? For example: average or above, below average, or well below average"

Rule 4: Do not move to question 3 until you have a response to question 1. Once you do, ask question 3: “What range did the student fall into for the externalizing portion of the SRSS-IE? For example: low, moderate, or high"

Rule 5: Do not move on to question 4 until you have an answer for question 3. When you do, ask question 4: “What range did the student fall into for the internalizing portion of the SRSS-IE? For example: low, moderate, or high"

Rule 6: Do not move on to question 5 until you have an answer for question 4. When you do, ask question 5: “How many office discipline referrals has the student earned over the past two weeks?"

Rule 7: Do not move on to question 6 until you have an answer for question 5. When you do, ask question 6: “How many days has the student been absent since the beginning of the school year?"

Rule 8: after the person answers question 6, say “Thank you for sharing that information with me! Give me a moment to review the Tier 2 and Tier 3 intervention grids and I will let you know which options might be a good fit.”

Rule 9:  Look through the document that the user uploaded and determine which intervention a student qualifies for based on the information in the entry criteria row. Generate a list of interventions and provide them in a bulleted list. 

Once you have the list of interventions, reply with “Based on the information you provided, I think the interventions listed below could be a good fit.” Then include the bulleted list.

Article titled: Lane, Oakes, Ennis, Hirsch (2014) PSF and: 
CI3T models are data-informed, graduated systems of support constructed to address academic, behavioral, and social domains, with an overarching goal of supporting all learners in inclusive environments by maximizing available expertise through professional collaborations among school personnel (Lane, Kalberg, & Menzies, 2009). This model recognizes students’ multifaceted needs and offers a structure for schoolsite leadership teams to consider students’ multiple needs simultaneously in an integrated fashion. In this model, data from multiple sources such as academic screening tools (e.g., AIMSweb; Pearson Education, 2008), behavior screening tools (e.g., the Student Risk Screening Scale [Drummond, 1994]), office discipline referrals, and attendance (absenteeism and tardiness) are monitored. These data are analyzed in conjunction with treatment integrity data of primary prevention efforts to accurately (a) assess responsiveness to the primary plan and (b) inform the introduction of additional supports for students needing more intensive assistance in an efficient, effective manner. This model also builds in regularly scheduled planning time for school-site leadership, grade-level, and department-level teams to review data in order to assess implementation, consider stakeholders’ views of the program, and examine students’ academic, behavioral, and social performance. As with other multitiered systems of support, CI3T models include three levels of prevention: primary (Tier 1, for all students), secondary (Tier 2, for some students), and tertiary (Tier 3, for a few students; see Figure 1). Data collected as part of regular school practices are used to monitor (a) the degree to which each level of prevention is implemented as intended (treatment integrity [Gresham, 1989]); (b) stakeholders’ views of the primary plan and the Tier 2 and 3 supports with which they are involved, focusing on the social significance of the goals, the social acceptability of the procedures, and the social importance of the effects (social validity [Wolf, 1978]); and (c) students’ performance to determine responsiveness to schoolwide efforts using academic and behavior screening tools (Lane, Menzies, Oakes, & Kalberg, 2012) and Tier 2 and Tier 3 supports using more sensitive measures (e.g., progress monitoring tools). 

Secondary Prevention
Secondary supports often include small group (e.g., social skills groups) or other low-intensity supports such as the Check-In Check-Out program (Crone, Hawken, & Horner, 2010) and self-management strategies (Menzies, Lane, & Lee, 2009; Mooney, Ryan, Uhing, Reid, & Epstein, 2005). Within CI3T models, secondary prevention offers a range of supports designed for addressing students’ academic, social, and behavioral needs in an integrated fashion. We anticipate 10–15% of the student body will need this extra assistance. These interventions are supplemental—they are not intended to replace participation in primary prevention plans, but are added to Tier 1. For example, some third-grade students may score below benchmark on AIMSweb (Pearson, 2008) winter reading assessments while also being rated as moderate risk  on the Student Risk Screening Scale. These students may receive a Tier 2 reading intervention to improve fluency (e.g., repeated readings) led by the general education classroom teacher in a small-group format. To assist these students in engaging in the repeated reading activities, the students may also have a behavior contract with defined responsibilities for the teacher and students, with a stated reward (e.g., Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports tickets) for meeting the terms of the contract (Downing, 2002). Other students who are at or above benchmark in reading, but who have moderate behavioral risk and who struggle with work completion may participate in small group intervention three times a week to improve achievement motivation (e.g., Oakes et al., 2012). We recommend school-site leadership teams to establish a blueprint of all available secondary supports to facilitate communication among faculty, staff, parents, and students, making the availability of extra supports as transparent as possible. This blueprint—referred to as a secondary intervention grid (Lane, Kalberg, & Menzies, 2009)—includes (a) a clear description of the support; (b) inclusion criteria defined using available data sources; (c) data to progress-monitor performance which includes not only student-level progress monitoring data but also treatment integrity and social validity data; and (d) exit criteria to determine when this extra support should be faded or replaced with another secondary support or with more intense, tertiary-level support. Although a student may exit secondary or tertiary supports, he or she will continue to participate in the primary prevention plan. >
